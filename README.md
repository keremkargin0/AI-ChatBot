# Turkish ChatBot with Deep Learning

Hello everyone! In this repository, there is a Turkish Chatbot project trained with the Deep Learning model. This Chatbot uses a Retrieval-Based structure.  In this form, the chatbot has a repository of responses that it uses to solve the queries. You need to choose an appropriate response based on the questions, and the chatbot will comply. Chat Bot consists of the following steps.
